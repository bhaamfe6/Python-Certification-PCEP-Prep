# Python-Certification-PCEP-Prep
This repository includes notes and scripts for my PCEP Certification exam preparation.  I started this journey in December 2022. 
I am following the Edube Interactive OpenEDG Python Institute Lab at https://edube.org/ in order to complete the PCEP-30-02 Certification exam.
