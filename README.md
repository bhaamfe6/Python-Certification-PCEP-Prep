# Python-Certification-PCEP-Prep
This repository includes notes and scripts for my PCEP Certification exam preparation.  I started this journey in December 2022. 
I am following the Edube Interactive OpenEDG Python Institute Lab at https://edube.org/ in order to complete the PCEP-30-02 Certification exam.
Some of my notes also come from w3schools Python Tutorial on https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp .
I have complete a few coding practice files in the Program folder.  
Lastly, I am also going through the THINK PYTHON eBook that I downloaded from Green Tea Press,https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/ .
